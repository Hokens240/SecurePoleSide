            <p>Effective Date: August 4, 2021</p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms” or this “Agreement”) govern the use of the electronic trading
                platform, including any website or mobile application (the “App”, together with the website, the
                “Site”) for accessing the platform, and any services provided through the platform (collectively,
                the “Platform”) provided by Thepeakcapital (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”). The Terms
                form a binding agreement between the Company and you, as an individual user (“you”, “your” or
                “User”) for your individual usage of the App and Platform. By registering for and downloading the
                App and using the Platform, you confirm your acceptance of this Agreement and our associated Privacy
                Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately uninstall the App and cease using
                the App and the Platform.</p>
            <p>1.Securities Disclaimer: No material or any other information which may be made available on the Site
                or Platform shall constitute or be construed as a recommendation, endorsement, offer, invitation or
                solicitation to enter into any transaction with or purchase any product, or otherwise deal with
                securities, crypto assets or other products. You further understand that none of the information
                providers, including any Third-Party Providers (as defined below) are advising you personally
                concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular security or crypto asset,
                portfolio of securities or crypto assets, transaction, investment strategy or other matter, and any
                information provided is not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. You understand
                that an investment in any security or crypto asset is subject to a number of risks, and that
                discussions of any security or crypto asset published on the Site or Platform may not contain a list
                or description of relevant risk factors. Please note that markets change continuously, so any
                information, content, Third-Party Content (as defined below) or other material provided on or
                through the Site or Platform may not be complete or current, or may be superseded by more current
                information. You rely on such information at your own risk.</p>
            <p>2.Changes</p>
            <p>2.Changes 2.1 We reserve the right at any time to:

                notifications through the Site or an email to the email address in your Account. For this reason,
                you should check our website regularly, allow the Site to receive such push notifications, and keep
                your email address and other contact information up to date in the Account. You accept any Changes
                if you continue to use the Site and Platform after such Changes are effected.</p>

                Platform, any information transmitted by, to or over the Platform and information regarding use of
                the Platform will remain with the Company or its licensors. Nothing on the Platform will be
                construed as conferring on any User any license, save as expressly set out herein, of any of the
                Company’s or any third party’s title, ownership rights and/or intellectual property rights, whether
                by estoppel, implication or otherwise.</p>

            <p>5.2The Platform and App may provide you access to content, information, quote, videos, photos or
                other materials (the “Third-Party Content”) supplied by certain third parties (the “Third-Party
                Content Providers”). The Company does not endorse or recommend, and is not responsible for verifying
                the accuracy, validity or completeness of any Third-Party Content provided through the Site or

            <p>(a)modify, adapt, reproduce, translate or create derivative works of the Site or Platform, or any
                data or content (including the Third-Party Content) provided through the Site or Platform, or any

                text from the Company’s Site or otherwise violate the Company’s intellectual property rights,
                including, without limitation, “scraping” text or images from the Company’s Site or the Company
                managed banners and/or text links, search marketing or all other online and offline campaigns,</p>

            <p>(d)edit, modify, filter, truncate or change the order of the information contained in any part of
                the Company’s Sites, or remove, obscure, or minimize any part of the Company’s Site in any way

            <p>(e)make any commercial use of the Site or Platform or the Company’s logo, trademark or brand name in
                any way.</p>

            <p>5.5Each User authorizes the Company to use any information or content provided by the User or
                processed in connection with the use of the Site and Platform (e.g. Personal Information, geographic
                information, device information) in the context and for the purpose of providing services or
                products on the Platform and the secure use of the Site and the Platform.</p>
            <p>6.Account</p>
            <p>6.1In order to use the services on the Platform, you must create an account with the Platform (the
                “Account”). The Account will be used to record various Digital Assets transferred by you onto the
                Platform and conduct transactions on the Platform. The Account may be registered by any individual
                who is over 18 years old or an institution by its duly authorized representatives, provided such
                individual and institution have read and understand the Risk Disclosure Statements , which is
                incorporated by reference into, and shall be a part of this Agreement. Each User shall only register
                one trading Account on the Platform. Registration of multiple trading Accounts would be a violation
                of these Terms and may lead to immediate termination of these Terms and the Accounts involved.</p>

            <p>6.2The Account is not a bank account and the Digital Assets held in the Account are not deposits or
                other financial products. Except as otherwise permitted by the Platform, no interest will be paid on
                any funds or Digital Assets under your Account, and all Digital Assets that are directly held by us
                for your benefit are not insured by any Governmental Authority.</p>

            <p>6.3You may fund the Account by transferring Digital Assets from your accounts with third parties
                into the Account. No fees are charged by the Platform for funding the Account; however, third
                parties, such as your bank, may charge transaction and other fees. The Digital Assets will be
                transferred to the Platform’s address for omnibus user account. The Platform will then credit your
                Account with such amount of Digital Assets on the Platform’s ledger.</p>

            <p>6.4You may withdraw all or some of the Digital Assets under your name recorded on the Platform’s
                ledger. There is no minimum amount of Digital Assets required to maintain your status as a User.
                Digital assets will be transferred from the omnibus user account held by the Platform to the
                specific Digital Assets address provided by you. Withdrawals may take up to three (3) days to
                complete, provided that larger withdrawals may take up to thirty (30) days to complete and that any
                withdrawal may be delayed as necessary to comply with Applicable Law and/or the Platform’s User
                Identification Policy.</p>
            <p>7.Third-Party Accounts</p>
            <p>7.1You may be offered the ability to register and establish a Third-Party Account with a Third-Party
                Services Provider. Such Third-Party Account shall be subject to terms and conditions and policies
                established by Third-Party Services Provider for such Third-Party Account (“Third-Party Services
                Provider Terms”).</p>

            <p>7.2You should read the Third-Party Services Provider Terms carefully before opening a Third-Party
                Account with such Third-Party Services Provider. If you do not agree to the Third-Party Services
                Provider Terms, you should not register and open the Third-Party Account with it. All trades and
                other transactions conducted through the Third-Party Account will be subject to the Third-Party
                Services Provider Terms. In addition, you understand and agree that:</p>

            <p>(a)The Company will act solely as the platform administrator and service provider for the
                Third-Party Service Provider in terms of the Third-Party Accounts. As such, the Company may collect
                your Personal Information and other information on behalf of the Third-Party Services Provider in
                the process of opening the Third-Party Account and providing the Platform for transactions conducted
                through the Third-Party Account. Such Personal Information will be processed by the Company in
                accordance with its Privacy Policy and will be shared with the Third-Party Services Provider, which
                will process such Personal Information in accordance with its own privacy policy.</p>

            <p>(b)The Company is not offering such Third-Party Account to you and has no responsibility or
                liability for such Third-Party Account or any transactions conducted through the Third-Party
                Account, or for any acts or omissions of the Third-Party Services Provider with respect to the
                Third-Party Accounts, Third-Party Services Provider Terms, or their processing of your Personal
                Information. The Company shall not be responsible for the transactions conducted by you or your
                Authorized Individuals with respect to your Third-Party Account. All inquiries and questions
                regarding the trading activities or other services with respect to the Third-Party Accounts that you
                submit to us will be directed by the Company to Third-Party Services Provider.</p>
            <p>8.Fees</p>
            <p>8.1There is no charge to download the App and register as a User, but we may charge for certain
                in-app purchases and other features as we may specify from time to time.</p>

            <p>8.2In exchange for access to the Platform and the Services, you agree to pay a fee on each settled
                transaction initiated by you (such fee, a “Transaction Fee”). The current Transaction Fee may be
                found on the Site after you log into your Account. We reserve the right to change, modify or
                increase the Transaction Fee at any time and from time to time. Any such changes, modifications or
                increases will be effective upon posting such changes, modifications or increases on the Site. If
                you do not agree to the posted changes, modifications, or increases, you should stop using the
                Account as provided herein. Your continued use of the Account following the posting of the modified
                Transaction Fee as posted on the Site will constitute the acceptance of all such changes or
                revisions.</p>

            <p>8.3Transaction Fees are paid by the trading parties in any given transaction. The trading parties
                will each be charged a fee in Bitcoin, USDT/USDC or other currencies from time to time approved by
                us. You
                are responsible for any fees imposed by third parties in connection with transferring Digital Assets
                into your Account on the Platform. The Platform charges a fee to transfer Digital Assets from your
                Account.</p>

            <p>8.4If you believe that you have been erroneously charged a Transaction Fee, you shall notify the
                Platform immediately of such error, along with any additional information concerning the
                transaction. If you do not raise any question or objection within thirty (30) days after such
                alleged erroneous Transaction Fee first appears on any Account statement, such fee will be deemed
                acceptable by you for all purposes.</p>

            <p>8.5You may be charged transaction and other fees in connection with your Third-Party Account. Any
                such fees are specified in the Third-Party Services Provider Terms. We have no responsibility or
                liability for any fees or other cost or charges you may incur in connection with such Third-Party
                Account.</p>
            <p>9.User Access Obligations</p>
            <p>9.1The Company will issue a set of unique User Credentials to each User that is registered to use
                the Site and Platform. Such User Credentials only allow the User to access the Account. Each User
                shall promptly provide acknowledgment of receipt of such User Credentials to the Company.</p>

            <p>9.2Each User acknowledges that each set of User Credentials is non-transferable and shall only be
                used by the User to whom it is issued. Such User Credentials shall not be disclosed to or transfer
                to any third person without written permission of the Company. We will never ask you, for any
                reason, whether by email, regular mail or telephone, to disclose your User Credentials. Password
                inquiries will only be conducted online and only after you have signed onto the Platform. We will
                never send you embedded links in an email requesting that you sign onto the Platform by clicking
                such a link. If you receive an embedded link by email, claiming to be from us or the Platform, you
                shall not open or click on the link. The email is not from us and is likely fraudulent.</p>

            <p>9.3Each User shall:</p>

            <p>(a)keep their User Credentials strictly confidential and not share them with any other person for
                any purpose including, but not limited to, initiating or executing any payment transaction involving
                the Account. Further, the User shall not disclose his/her User Credentials in a recognizable way to
                third parties on any device (for example, by writing down or recording the User Credentials without
                disguising them);</p>

            <p>(b)take all reasonable efforts to secure all records relating to his/her User Credentials,
                including, but not limited to, keeping such records in a secure or physical location accessible or
                known only to the User and keeping such records in a place where the records are unlikely to be
                accessed by a third party;</p>

            <p>(c)take all reasonable measures to follow security instructions provided by the Company and
                otherwise protect the security, prevent tampering or use by any other person of the User
                Credentials, Site or Platform, including those security measures prescribed in our Privacy Policy;
            </p>

            numbers that are consecutive or basing the PIN on the User’s contract ID, birth date, telephone
            number, identification number, or any other easily accessible personal information).</p>

            <p>9.4Where the Platform is accessed by correct entry of User Credentials or through the App, the

                with or without your knowledge. Upon receipt of notification under Section 11.3(d), the Company
                shall disable the relevant User Credentials and block access to the Platform or the Site as soon as
                reasonably practicable.</p>

            <p>9.5Each User shall secure all of their devices or systems used to access the Platform (for example,
                the App), including, without limitation, installing and regularly updating browsers, security
                patches, antivirus, anti-malware and other relevant software in the devices or systems. Each User
                shall also comply with all instructions, procedures and directions relating to the Platform, the
                Site and User Credentials as notified the Company from time to time, including, but not limited to,
                the risk management and other measures notified at the Platform login page.</p>
